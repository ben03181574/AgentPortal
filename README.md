# AgentPortal
This project implements an intelligent AI Agent capable of navigating and executing complex, branched Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). By leveraging Neo4j as a knowledge graph and LangChain4j as the orchestration framework, the agent bridges the gap between high-level human instructions and low-level system executions via the MCP.
